          body: "This question tests whether you researched the company. Answer requires: (1) something specific about their product/mission/culture that genuinely excites you, (2) how your skills connect to their current challenges, (3) what you want to learn or build there. 'Good salary' is never the answer — even if it's true.",

          body: "They're not asking for a career plan — they're asking: will you leave in 6 months, and do you have ambition? Answer: show growth ambition within the domain (not 'your job'). 'I want to go deeper in distributed systems and eventually lead architecture decisions for high-scale products' is strong. 'I want to be a manager' is fine if it fits the role.",

          title: "How Do You Manage Your Time and Priorities?",
          body: "Walk them through your actual system — not a textbook answer. Mention: how you prioritise competing tasks (impact vs effort), how you handle interruptions, how you communicate when timelines shift. Use a real example: 'In my last role two deadlines collided — I did X to negotiate and Y to deliver.' Tools are fine to mention but the system matters more.",

Give a range anchored at the high end of reasonable: 'Based on my research and experience, I'm targeting X–Y, but I'm open to the full package.' Don't give a single number — it anchors too low. Don't say 'whatever is fair' — it signals no self-worth.",

Show that you addressed the issue directly, not passively. Key signals: you kept the relationship intact, you focused on the problem not the person, you learned something. 'I avoid conflict' is a disqualifier.",

The Result must be measurable or at least concrete. Common mistake: candidates spend 80% on the situation and 20% on the action — flip it.",

Good questions: 'What does success look like in the first 90 days?', 'What's the biggest technical challenge the team is facing?', 'How does the team handle disagreements on technical direction?', 'What do you wish you'd known before joining?' These signal preparation, curiosity, and that you're evaluating them too.",
